This project is a poster series created for National Drug Facts Week. The philosophy behind this poster series is harm reduction. This means to neither condone nor condemn recreational drug use, but to provide a basis of information for students to form around the effects and uses of drugs so they can make safe and informed decisions. The entire series was created in Adobe InDesign.
