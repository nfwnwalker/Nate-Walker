The bearded dragon is an omnivorous reptile native to central Australia. This infographic communicates the growth and diet of Nate Walkerâ€™s bearded dragon through the first year of its life. The challenges involved in this project were communicating a variety of information in an engaging and organized means all within the bounds of a mobile device. All icons were created in Adobe Illustrator, and animations done in Adobe After Effects.
