Two book jacket variations were created for the Kurt Vonnegut short story, “Thanasphere”. The story takes place during the 1950’s, as the American military attempts to send their first astronaut into Earth’s orbit. Similar in tone to many of Vonnegut’s work, this story creates an ominous and dark atmosphere, of which the covers imitate. This project involves a combination of elements made in Adobe Photoshop and layout using Adobe InDesign.
