    <p>Hello! I’m Nate Walker.</p>

    <p>I am a New York based designer and a graduate of Binghamton University with a BFA in graphic design and an MBA in marketing. Driven by my love of conceptualization and problem-solving, I began my studies in college as a physics major. However, after exposure to design theory classes, I realized that I could better apply these passions by combining them with my fervor for creativity. This led me to pursue a Bachelor’s in Fine Art. From a desire to learn more about design’s role in industry, I carried on my education to pursue a Master’s in Business Administration with a focus in marketing.</p>

    <p>My personal hobbies include drawing comics, woodworking, reading, and watching cartoons. On top of this, I am a major animal lover, and aspire to one day have my own chicken coop. If I’m not outside hiking, you can find me in the kitchen trying new recipes, or at least watching one of my favorite cooking channels on YouTube. I consider myself a dabbler, always looking for new hobbies and activities to broaden my perspective!</p>
